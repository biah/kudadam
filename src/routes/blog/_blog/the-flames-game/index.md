## What is FLAMES?

Flames is an acronym which stands out for _"Friends Lovers Admirers Marriage Enemies 'Secret Lovers'"_. This game can determine the relationship between two people with the use of their names. It is usually played among teens to find if they are compatible with their crushes:laughing: <small><i>Well, I played some before and it was fun</i></small>. Even though some websites use different meanings for the acronym, the words they use are just synonyms to the original, but the meaning above, is the original.

## Who Invented The FLAMES Game?

Though it is unknown who invented the game, research I made shows that the game was created around the 90's, that's a really really long time ago. And... it was played among kids and teenagers.

## Is the FLAMES Game Real?

Simple answer, No. Other answer, well, it depends. The results you get after playing the game can actually go in your favour or it might not. Though it uses a simple algorithm, it can be real when it's results are true for you.

Technically speaking, the results produced are not real, it's just the results from a mathematical formula, so naa!!, __It's not__.

## How To Play The Game

The original version of FLAMES is played on a paper. So you will need a pen and paper.

* __Write your name and your partner's name on a piece of paper__

  On the piece of paper, you are to write your full name and your partner's full name. Though this is not necessary, it is the best way to test your FLAMES. Also, don't use nicknames.

  For example; we will use the names _"Tony Stark"_ & _"Pepper Stark"_

  

* __Cancel out the common letters in both names__

  Now, you are to cancel out the common letters in both of the names irrespective of the case in which the letters are written in. Note that, you are only to cancel out an instance of the letter in both names, not all instances of the letter.

  We then get <i>"Tony" <del>Stark</del>"</i> & <i>"Pepper <del>Stark</del>"</i>.

* __Count  the number of remaining letters__

  We then count the number of letters which were not cancelled in both names.

  So we combine the un-cancelled letters and get _"TonyPepper"_. We then count the number and get  10.

* __We then compare the number to the acronym FLAMES__

So we start assigning each number to each letter in the acronym, like 1 -> F, 2->L,3->A,... till we get to 10. If we get to the end of the acronym, we restart the counter till we get to ten. For example, 6 -> S so 7 will then start at F again till we get to the end of the number.

So the number 10, will end at M. We then compare the answer to this simple table below.

| Letter | Meaning       |
| ----- | ------------- |
| F      | Friendship    |
| L      | Lovers        |
| A      | Admirers      |
| M      | Marriage      |
| E      | Enemies       |
| S      | Secret Lovers |



So, the relationship between _"Tony Stark"_ and _"Pepper Stark"_ is Marriage.

## Conclusion

So fellas, that's all about the FLAMES game. Go ahead and try it out.
