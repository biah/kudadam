<p class="intro">
    I haven't sent my subscribers a newsletter in a very long time. Although I have one on my website, the truth is that I have never written one. I suppose I'll need to start treating it seriously now.
</p>

My main inspiration for including a newsletter on mine came from the fact that the majority of tech bloggers had them on their websites. I initially started using [Sendinblue](https://www.sendinblue.com/), but I soon stopped using it because of how difficult it was to use. [Substack](https://substack.com/) was my next attempt, but they lacked a suitable API, so I gave up and settled on [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/). Despite being managed by just one person, it is the best.

## A promise to myself

I make a solemn commitment to take my newsletter seriously starting today. I'm reading articles about how to create the best newsletter possible. I currently have 17+ subscribers.
Even though it is small, I intend to grow it.
I receive a few of my fellow tech developers' newsletters, but I prefer RSS.
RSS truly is a marvel.

## Conclusion

I'm going to start my newsletter right away because I do want to get better at producing high-quality content.
Hey, you should sign up for my newsletter if you haven't already.
Enjoy your day!:smile:
