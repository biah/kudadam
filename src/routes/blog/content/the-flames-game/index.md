The **FLAMES** game, which is commonly played by children, can detect the relationship between two people by using their names.

## What is FLAMES?

Flames is an acronym which stands out for ‚ÄúFriends Lovers Admirers Marriage Enemies ‚ÄòSecret Lovers‚Äô ‚Äù. This game can determine the relationship between two people using their names. It is usually played among teens to find out if they are compatible with their crushesüòÑ. Well, I played some before, and it was fun. Even though some websites use different meanings for the FLAMES acronym, it is good to stick to one definition. I suggest you stick to the definition above because it‚Äôs the perfect fit and the meaning I‚Äôve known since childhood.

## Who Invented The FLAMES Game?

Despite the fact that the game's creator is unknown, research I conducted indicates that it was likely produced in the 1990s, which is a very long time ago. Additionally, children and teenagers played it.

## Is the FLAMES Game Real?

The short answer is no. Another possibility is that it depends. The outcome of the game you play may or may not be favourable to you. Though it is based on a simple algorithm, it can be trusted if the results are accurate for you.

Technically, the outcomes produced are not real; they are the output of a mathematical procedure.

## How To Play The Game

The original version of FLAMES is played on paper. So you will need a pen and paper.

1. **Write your name and your partner's name on a piece of paper**

You must write your full name and your partner's full name on the sheet of paper. Though not required, this is the best way to test your FLAMES. Also, avoid using nicknames.

For example, "Tony Stark" and "Pepper Stark" will be used.

2. **Cancel out the common letters in both names**

You must now cancel out the common letters in both names, regardless of the case in which the letters are written. It is important to note that you must only cancel out one instance of the letter in both names, not all instances of the letter.

Then we have "Tony" ~~Stark~~ and "Pepper ~~Stark~~."

3. **Count the number of remaining letters**
   The number of letters that were not eliminated in both names is counted.
   So we join the unscrambled letters to get "TonyPepper." The number is then counted, and we obtain 10.

4. **We then compare the number to the acronym FLAMES**

So we begin by allocating each number to each letter in the acronym, such as 1 to F, 2 to L, 3 to A, and so on, until we reach 10. When we reach the end of the acronym, we reset the counter until we reach ten. For example, 6 to S, thus 7 will begin again at F till we reach the end of the number.

As a result, the number 10 will finish at M. The solution is then compared to the basic table below.

| Letter | Meaning       |
| ------ | ------------- |
| F      | Friendship    |
| L      | Lovers        |
| A      | Admirers      |
| M      | Marriage      |
| E      | Enemies       |
| S      | Secret Lovers |

So, the relationship between¬†"Tony Stark"¬†and¬†"Pepper Stark" is marriage.
