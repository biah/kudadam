When we visit a nice-looking website, we almost always want to glance at its HTML source code. On desktop browsers, we simply right-click and select "see page source" from the context menu, but on mobile devices, there is no such option. So, how do we look at the source code on a mobile device?

If we are to observe carefully, whenever we click on "view page source" on a desktop browser, it opens a new url in this format `view-source:https://path/to/url`.
If we apply this same trick on a mobile device, it works as expected.

## Steps to view source code

1. Visit the website which you want to view it's source code.

2. Click inside the address bar and append `view-source:` before the url of the website.

3. Click the send button and the page will load with the source code of the file.

**NB:** Even though I used Chrome's mobile browser, the method is the same in all the major browsers.
