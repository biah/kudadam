	<h1 class="text-center">About me</h1>
	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>
		Hey, I'm Lucretius Biah, a software and web developer (yeah, I do both) located in Ghanaüåç. I'm
		a self-taught teen developer, and I have been coding since I was 14, starting with the Python
		programming language. I also love to write. You can find some of <a href="/blog"
			>my articles in the blog section</a
		>.
	</p>
	<h2>What I do</h2>
	<p>
		Simply put, I develop software and design websites. You may be wondering why I do both. I began
		as a software developer, creating programmes in Python and Ruby. Then I learnt web development
		to create simple web pages to showcase the utilities that I developed. I was involved in web
		development before I realised it.<br />
		I create responsive and accessible websites; this one, for example, employs modern best practises
		to ensure usability. The accessible websites which I build ensures that content is available to all
		users, irrespective of their disability.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also have experience in developing software. It is basically what drew me into programming and
		what I have been doing since I started programming. Also, I create reliable software. I create
		softwares which are scalable whiles not comprimissing user experience.<br />
		You can check out my <a href="/projects">projects section</a> to view some of my projects.

	<h2>The Other Me</h2>
	<p>
		I'm not always tethered to a terminal or IDE. In addition, I do a range of other activities.<br
		/>
		I'm an avid reader who adores books. I'm usually reading a book, whether it's on my phone or a physical
		copy. One of my favourite books is
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_W._Dixon">Franklin Dixon‚Äôs</a>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardy_Boys">Hardy Boys</a>. It‚Äôs a series about two
		teenagers who are amateur detectives helping to solve mysteries and also catching bad guys.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the exception of sports games, I play a lot of games across all genres. PUBG and Call of
		Duty: Mobile are the battle royale games I play the most. <a

		> and let‚Äôs play.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the moment, this is all I can recall of myself. This is it. At least until I remember
		more.üôÇ
