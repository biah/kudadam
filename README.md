# Kudadam

This is my personal website where I do whatever I want to do. 

The website is built with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) and made with  :heart:



## Contributing

As always, contributions as welcome. In order to contribute, just follow the guide below.

Do note that the website is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) so it's syntax is a little different from your normal HTML.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/biah/www.kudadam.com.git
npm install
npm run dev
npm run watch:tailwind #Open this in another terminal after `npm run dev`
```

### Contributing to the Toolz section

The toolz section of my website is a place where I create useful JavaScript based tools. Over there, you can find almost every tool you will ever need. From very useful ones to very useless ones. 

You can add a tool to the toolz section if you wish or you can fix a bug in the already existing tools. You are very welcome.

### Contributing to the Blog section

The blog section is a place where I write about almost everything I know. If you feel like adding yours, you can create a new markdown file in the blog directory and write your blog post. Just follow the format of the other blog posts and everything will be okay



## Deployment

This website is hosted on my own server. The building of the website is done automatically by [Buddy Works](https://buddy.works). 

The site is rebuilt on every push to the master branch.
